        Some products sold on Legacy Racing are designed for OFF-ROAD usage only. Products may not be compliant with state enforcement or emission regulations and laws for usage on public roads. Customers must be fully aware and are responsible for ensuring that the product they purchase is compliant with state enforcement or emission regulations within the state they reside in. We are not responsible for the consequences customers are involved in if they purchase a product that is not legal for road.
RETURN POLICY
•	All returns are subject to a 25% re-stocking fee. Re-stocking fees will not apply if there was a defect caused by the manufacturer or if there was a mistake made on behalf of Legacy Racing.
•	Customers will have a standard of 30 days after receiving their product to return their purchase if unsatisfied, unless noted otherwise. Any day beyond the 30-day period we CANNOT refund you of your purchase.
•	Returned products MUST be in brand new, sellable condition as received. The original packaging for the product is required and must be kept in excellent condition as well. Products or packages that do not meet this standard will NOT meet the policies of returning the product, thus we cannot accept/finalize the return process.
•	Shipping, handling, and transaction fees during the return process are non-refundable. Customers who wish to return their products would be responsible for all transaction fees to return products back to Legacy Racing.
•	Approved refunds after inspection of the returned product will be issued in 1-3 business days.
ORDER CANCELLATIONS
•	If you had just placed an order and would like to cancel your order, contact us immediately.
•	Customers who would like to cancel their order are subject to a 3% order cancellation fee. This cancellation fee applies to orders that have been placed but have not been shipped yet.
•	If your order has shipped and you would like to cancel it, your order would be classified as a “Return,” and a 25% re-stocking fee would be imposed. It is your responsibility to act hastily if you would like to cancel an order you had just made.
•	Cancellation refunds are issued in 1-3 business days.
•	Your purchase would be fully reimbursed if there is a fault on our end that results in an order cancellation. Product unavailability does NOT apply to this condition, meaning if a product is out of stock, if the customer is aware the product is out of stock and an order is placed, the customer is still subject to a 3% order cancellation fee.
SPECIAL ORDERS
•	Special Orders include but are not limited to:
- Custom Wheels (Custom Specifications/Finishes)
- Custom Suspension (Custom Coilovers/Air Suspension, etc.)
- Customized Products
•	ALL special orders are NON-REFUNDABLE as the product is a customized product for one customer and cannot be sold to others.<br><br>
